# Gobbler

* Hear what people are **talking** about, Gobble it up, and best but not least **EDIT your Gobbles!**
* I know what you're thinking what makes our app special? We give you a feature that twitter can't give you, which includes being able to edit your own Gobbles you put out on your feed.


## Technologies used:
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Twit
* Passport
* Twitter API
* Node.js
* Express
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Heroku

## RESTful API Endpoints
| Endpoint          | Purpose                  |
| -------------     |:-------------:           |
| /api/gobbles      | returns all gobbles      |
| /api/users        | returns all users        |
| /api/gobbles/:id  | returns a single gobble  |

## Unsolved Problems 
* Using web sockets for real time communication b/w clients and servers.
* Having a feed of other user's Gobbles, basically a timeline.

## Future Enhancements
* Being able to Regobble, favorite Gobbles, and comment on Gobbles. 
* Being able to search for another user and seeing their Gobbles.
